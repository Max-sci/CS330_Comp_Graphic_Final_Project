When I work on a software project, I try to think of the end product, and then break it down into smaller steps. Likely, this course broke down the final project into multiple milestone assignments that the professor was grading to ensure we were progressing as expected. The final project was to recreate a 2D image into a 3D environment, so I decided to recreate my workspace. I started with the main objects, such as the table and my laptop, and then added other objects, including the computer mouse and my water bottle, to make the 3D environment more realistic. I spend a lot of time focusing on how each piece would fit together, their scale, and placement. This project unlocked new design skills that I had not previously worked on, which helps me translate real-world items into a 3D environment. Before this project, I never paid attention to proportions, details, and lighting, so now I have a basic understanding of how design decisions are made and how they impact the overall space.
I had a very iterative design process. I created an object, tested it in the scene, then went back to the code and made adjustments needed to its size, orientation, or position until it looked like the photo. I had to scrap some ideas sometimes and start over again because I couldn't get it right. I gained a better eye for visual accuracy due to the back-and-forth approach, and I can use this eye whether building in a different type of code or I’m back designing graphics.
I tried to build the project layer by layer like a painting. I would first create the object's structure, then add more complex details like textures, and finally add transformations, shading, and lighting effects. I tried to write the code in a straight forward fashion, so every object was easy to find and adjust. To make the object what I envisioned, I had to tweak the code, test it to see how it looked, and then make adjustments. The more I spent on the project, the more my coding approach evolved from just making the environment look good to thinking about each object’s relationship with each other and to making it look functional. I became more organized and intentional, which sped up my workflow and made the project come together nicely. 
I can now visualize a 3D environment and have the skills to create it. I think more critically about design, and I know my skills will be valuable in my studies and beyond. Having experience working with graphics and visualization can help me professionally because those skills can be applied to various fields, such as software design, engineering, and gaming. I just love having the idea that I can bring abstract ideas into a visual, interactive environment, and those skills have expanded how I think about computer science in the real world and academia.
